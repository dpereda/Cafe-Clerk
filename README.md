Welcome to Cafe-Clerk
======

This is my own project to see if I can teach myself Meteor.js and learn to code.

IDEA: A Web and App interface to alert facilities that the different break rooms(cafes) are out of stock or there is a problem.

Update 2016
=======
I lost alot of the updates i did to this because I didnt push it.  I have updated it to Meteor 1.3, but I need to add pub and sub back in as it is still using insecure.

The rest of these comment still hold true for this version.

My UI sucks currently.

Need to be able to pull the button labels in without retyping everyone as a value.

Add a Cafe ID and record into the DB.

Ability to delete an alerts.

Remove insecure.

Build back end for Faclities to monitor.
    Text alerts

Admin interface to make listings dynamic/custom.

Clean up the UI.

Deploy to Web, Android and iOS for internam beta.

Clean up/refactor and deploy for all to use.

Thanks!
