Welcome to Cafe-Clerk

This is my own project to see if I can teach myself meteor and lern to code.

IDEA: A Web and App interface to alert facilities that the diffrent break rooms(cafes) are out of stock or there is a problem.

My UI sucks currently.

Need to be able to pull the button labels in without retyping everyone as a value.

Add a Cafe ID and record into the DB.

Ability to delete an alerts.

Remove insecure.

Build back end for Faclities to monitor.
    Text alerts

Admin interface to make listings dynamic/custom.

Clean up the UI.

Deploy to Web, Android and iOS for internam beta.

Clean up/refactor and deploy for all to use.

Thanks!
